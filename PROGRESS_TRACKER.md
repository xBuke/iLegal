## üìù Notes

### Technology Decisions:
1. **SQLite vs PostgreSQL**: Using SQLite for development simplicity. Will migrate to PostgreSQL for production.

2. **NextAuth.js vs Clerk**: Chose NextAuth.js v5 for zero cost and full control. Clerk would be $25+/month.

3. **Soft Deletes**: All deletions are soft (data preserved with `deletedAt` timestamp) for legal compliance.

4. **Multi-tenancy**: Row-level security via `organizationId` on all tables.

### Development Notes:
- App runs on port 3005 (ports 3000-3004 were in use)
- Database location: `prisma/dev.db`
- Environment config: `.env` file
- All strings in Croatian (Hrvatski) for target market

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test Week 3 Features**
   - Test time tracking (manual entry and timer)

   - Test role-based permissions

2. **Week 4 Planning**
   - Invoice PDF generation
   - Payment tracking system
   - Expense tracking
   - Case timeline and activity logs
   - Global search functionality

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Add input validation (Zod schemas)
   - Add loading states
   - Add error boundaries
   - Add unit tests
