### Option 3: Paddle

### Recommendation Summary

| Stage | Recommended | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **MVP Launch** | Lemon Squeezy or Stripe | Lemon Squeezy for speed (no VAT hassle), Stripe if you have business setup |
| **Growth Phase** | Stripe | Best balance of features, cost, and control |
| **Enterprise Focus** | Paddle or Stripe | Advanced B2B features, mature subscription management |

**My Top Pick**: Start with **Stripe** if you have or can quickly set up a Croatian business entity. The lower fees (1.4% vs 5%) will save significant money as you scale, and Croatian banks work well with Stripe. If you want to launch in 2-3 weeks without business setup, use **Lemon Squeezy** for MVP, then migrate to Stripe later.
